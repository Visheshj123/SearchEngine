in command-line, run "make" in project repo. Then run "./test". 

Progam will prompt user to enter number of buckets, this is to create a HashMap to store words. 
Next the program will ask to enter "S or X", X will quit the program and S will enter the search query where users can enter in their search phrase. 
Program will remove "stop words" that appear in all three documents in order to improve performance. Output will be list of documents.
